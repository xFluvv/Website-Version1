       <b>This is our current beta website, It will not be publicised for a little while for know. However, products will be announced on here and then on our instagram. Drops will be exclusive to the website, and no drops will be on instagram due to bad payment methods, and paypal is not the best form of currency and or payment method.

    <p>Hello this is my first ever website, for my small company named Floqs. The company is a small collaboration project between me and my friend Zach. We are building this website to advertise our Balisong Products.
        We hope that this website will be able to redirect you perfectly to the products, and have a beautiful look when finished. 

    </p> Here is a BRS Replicant, It is very overpriced :)
